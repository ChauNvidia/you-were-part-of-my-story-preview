What I found is a community that showed up fully: alumni who are brilliant, accomplished, and deeply committed to lifting others as they move forward. Now I'm paying it forward by continuing to build what's next for this network, because this summit was just one chapter.",

    letter: "Larry, the Gates Millennium Scholarship let me earn a bachelor's in Biology and a master's in Educational Policy and Leadership without a dollar of student loan debt — freedom that shaped everything that came after. What I built with it is a career in student affairs, and later, after stepping away in 2017 to care for my mother until she passed in 2019, the courage to found Wellthy Reflections LLC, creating restorative spaces for people navigating grief, burnout, and life transitions. Now I'm paying it forward by bringing the same care, encouragement, and belief that shaped me into every space I create for someone else.",

What I found there is a community built on shared purpose, mentorship, and a genuine commitment to expanding opportunity for scholars. Now I'm paying it forward by helping guide this network forward, grateful for the invitation and already looking forward to the next one.",
